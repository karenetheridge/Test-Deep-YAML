see tequila repo (and stash) - trying to figure out if we can use YAML::Tiny
instead, or what encoding issues there might be.
It looks like not all backends are consistent -- as we already learned in
Berlin --
YAML::Tiny, YAML are correct
YAML::Syck is brain-dead with utf8
and YAML::XS expects to be given a byte string (utf8 octets), not character
string (unicode wide characters)
